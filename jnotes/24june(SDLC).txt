SDLC 
=====
SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.

SDLC is a process adopt by IT industries to develop accurate and quality of software's.

There are six phases present in SDLC.

1) Feasibility study 

2) Analysis 

3) Designing 

4) Coding 

5) Testing 

6) Delivery and Maintainence



1) Feasibility study 
--------------------
Feasibility study depends upon TELOS formulea.
ex:
	T - Technical Feasibility 
	E - Economical Feasibility 
	L - Legal Feasibility 
	O - Operational Feasibility 
	S - Schedule Feasibility 

All the above information they will keep in a document called BDD.
BDD stands for Business Design Document.


2) Analysis 
------------
In analysis phase, system analyst or product owner will involved.

They will seperate system requirements and software requirements.

They will keep in a document called SRS.

SRS stands for Software Requirement Specification.


3) Designing 
--------------
We have two types of designing.

1) High Level Designing (HLD)
-----------------------------
A manager is responsible to perform high level designing.

In high level designing , they will design main/major modules.


2) Low Level Designing (LLD)
------------------------------
A team lead is responsible to perform low level designing.

In low level designing, they will design child/sub modules.

All the above information they will keep in a document called PDD/TDD.
PDD stands for Project Design Document.
TDD stands for Technical Design Document.


4) Coding 
---------
In coding phase, developers will involved.
Developers are responsible to generate the build and perform unit testing.


5) Testing 
-----------
In testing phase, testing team or QA team will involved.
They will use one software component called STLC to remove all the bugs from the project and they make our project as bug free.


6) Delivery and Maintainence
----------------------------
Before delivery they perform UAT testing.

UAT stands for User Acceptance Testing.

It is classified into two types.

i) Alpha Testing 

ii) Beta Testing
