History of Java 
===============
In 1990, Sun Micro System took one project to develop a software called consumer electronic device which can be controlled by a remote like setup box. That time project was called Stealth project and later it is renamed to Green project.

James Gosling, Mike Sheradin and Patrick Naughton were there to develop the project and they have met in a place called Aspan/Colarado to start the work with Graphic System. James Gosling decided to use C and C++ languages to develop the project. But the problem what they have faced is C and C++ languages are system dependent. Then James Gosling decided why don't we create our own programming language whcih is system independent.

In 1991, they have developed a programming language called an OAK. OAK means coffee seed name and it is a national tree for many contries like Germany, France, USA and etc. 

In 1995, they have renamed OAK to JAVA. Java is a island of an Indonasia where first coffee of seed was produced and during the develop of project they were consuming lot of coffee's. Hence symbol of java is a cup of coffee with saucer.
