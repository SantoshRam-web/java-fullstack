Comments in Java 
================
Comments are created for documentation purpose.

Comments are used to improve readability of our code.

It is highly recommanded to use comments in regular programming.

Diagram: class1.1

Comments are not display in output because they won't compiled by the compiler.

In java, we have two types of comments.

1) Single line comment 
----------------------
	It is used to comment a single line.
	ex:
		// comment here 

2) Multiple line comment 
-------------------------
	It is used to comment multiple lines.
	ex:
		/*
			-
			-
			-
		*/

ex:
----

//class declaration 
class Test
{
	//main method 
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{

		//variable declaration 
		int x = 10;

		//output stmt
		System.out.println(x);
	}
}

Project 
========
It is an individual or collaborative enterprise that is carefully planned to achieve a particular aim/goal.

Technically, a project is a collection of modules.

We have following list of modules.

ex:
	admin module 
	login module 
	registration module 
	payment module 
	report generation module 
	and etc.

Every project contains two domains.

1) Technical domain 
---------------------
	Technical domain describes what technology we used to develop the project.
	ex:
		Java

2) Functional domain 
----------------------
	Functional domain describes state of a project.
	ex:
		Healthcare domain 
		Insaurance domain 
		Banking domain 
		ERP domain 
		and etc.
