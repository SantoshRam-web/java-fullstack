Identifiers
===========
A name in java is called identifier.

It can be variable name, method name, class name or label name.

ex:
	class Test 
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			int x = 10;

			System.out.println(x); 
		}
	}
	Here Test, main, args and x are identifiers.

Rules to declare an identifiers
-------------------------------
Rule1:
------
	Identifier will accept following characters.
	ex:
		A-Z
		a-z
		0-9
		_
		$
Rule2:
------
	If we take other characters then we will get compile time error.
	ex:
		int emp_id; 
		int stud#No; //invalid 
		int emp$alary; 

Rule3:
------
	Every identifier is a case sensitive.
	ex:
		int a=10;
		int A=10;

Rule4:
------
	We can't take reserved words as an identifiers.
	ex:
		int  if; //invalid 
		int  else; //invalid 
		int  for; //invalid 

Rule5:
------
	Identifier must and should strarts with alphabet, underscore or dollar symbol 
	but not with digit.
	ex:
		int a1234; 
		int _abcd; 		
		int $;
		int 1abcd; //invalid 

Rule6:
------
	There is no length limit for an identifiers but it is not recommanded to 
	take more then 15 characters.

Reserved Words 
===============
There are some identifiers which are reserved to associate some functionality or meaning such type of identifiers are called reserved words.

Java supports 53 reserved words and it is classified into two types.
