Flavours in Java 
=================
We have three flavours in java.

				Java
	|--------------------------|------------------------|
	JSE/J2SE 		JEE/J2EE		JME/J2ME 
(Java Standard Edition)	 (Java Enterprise Edition)  (Java Micro Edition)

> Standalone app 	 > Distributed app  		> Mobile App 

> Desktop app 		 > Enterprise app 

> Two-tier app 		 > ERP app 

			 > N-tier app  


> Standalone app 
-----------------
A normal java program which contains main method is called standalone application.

ex:
	class  Test
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{

	Control Panel 
	Recycle Bin 
	and etc.


> Two-tier app
--------------

Diagram: class3.2



> Distributed app
-------------------
Diagram: class3.3

In client/server application, if multiple request goes to main server then main server will distribute those request to it's parallel server's to reduce the burdun of main server such type of application is called distributed application.


> Enterprise app
